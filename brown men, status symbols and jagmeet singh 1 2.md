this will be the brown men and status symbols stuff ,,


Last November, Jagmeet Singh, leader of the NDP was lambasted by a number of ___ for carrying a Versace tote.
Ostensibly, this sort of discourse is par for the course for right-wing commentators. Taking aim at the aesthetics of politics rather than material consequence, and offering commentary littered with inaccuracies. In a time where 
- the leader of the Opposition co-owns a real estate investment company that owns a rental property \[3]
- his wife owns a rental property \[3]

- the intellectual titan Tristin Hooper even published an entire roleplay, assuming the identity of the bag. \[2]

A beard and a turban sometimes conjure up negative associations, but if you see someone with a lime colored, bright orange, or pink turban, it disarms people’s stereotypical notions of this image and it disarms people from those stereotypes. It became a way for me to extend my platform as a politician. Because I was considered stylish, with these colorful turbans and well-cut suits and showing myself as confident person, I could use that as a tool to talk about things like unfairness, injustice, poverty, and inequality in thef public sphere.





Singh is by no means a champion of the working class. But his clothing isn't the tell. In his case, it never could be. The gucci whatever he adorns - they are what legitimize him in the eyes of the public as a candidate, 'despite' his brownness. 



The issue of what Jagmeet Singh wears can be viewed through the lens of race, religion and political lines. 





### thesis

The prototypical image of western professionalism does not map onto minoritized bodies. To circumvent this, and to enter white-dominated domains, people of colour must transcend the dominant cultural narratives they exist in. 

### his airness transcending blackness

Take the NBA for example. The NBA has historically been faced with the challenge of marketing a 'sanitized' black product to white viewers for entertainment consumption. This was easy when the supremely marketable Michael Jordan was the face of the league. Even during his early playing days, Jordan was *the* All-American, more so than even Larry Bird, his legendary (white) contemporary. 

Jordan's then-agent, David Falk remarked that: "In the age of TV sports, if you were to create a media athlete and star for the '90s—spectacular talent, midsized, well-spoken, attractive, accessible, old-time values, wholesome, clean, natural, not too Goody Two-shoes, with a little bit of deviltry in him—you'd invent Michael. He's the first modern crossover in team sports. We think he transcends race, transcends basketball."

Jordan was black. In the same Raeganite, colourblind breath, Jordan was seen as a bastion of social mobility, racial tolerance, and the meritocratic American dream. With an image carefully managed both by himself and his marketing directors, Jordan quickly became the post-racial poster boy of the league. Jordan tactically traded away his 'baggy sweats' and his 'Brink's truck worth of jewelry' for bespoke suits. Sports journalist Rick Telander commented that Jordan had "so carefully nurtured his image as the all-American role model that he refuses to go anywhere, get into any situation, that might detract from that image." All at once, corporate America fell in love with their race-transcending superstar. Per Falk, the frenzy grew to such heights that Jordan had at one point turned down $300 million worth of deals in the span of four months.

**\[explain more here about how it is only through this image that he was able to be stomached by white america!]**
- kinda like the last paragraph of this section - the one that starts with "The race-transcending ..."


EXPAND THIS NEXT SECTION! use linked provided..

Throughout his career, Jordan maintained a deliberately quiet record of activism and philanthropy. Having played for both Chicago, a city with a history of racial inequality and "increasing gang violence" and then Washington, another city where black communities suffered from high incarceration rates and poor public schools, Jordan's voice 'would have carried tremendous weight'. 
https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2979/spectrum.4.2.01?seq=6






Activist and former teammate Etan Thomas recalled that "He mentioned an event at an all-white golf club, where of course they let Michael play, but there were no Black members, and how Michael threatened at the last minute to back out if they didn’t change their policy." Thomas had then told Michael, ‘That’s something people should know and then maybe they wouldn’t be saying the things they do about you.’ ‌to which MJ responded, ‘I don’t do that.’

MJ knew that being too overtly associated with social justice causes would hurt his bottom line. For that very reason, he could never be an agent for change in the way that other basketball greats, like Bill Russell and Kareem Abdul Jabbar were. But in a way that only a post-racial, commodifiable black superstar could, Jordan made it so that corporate America thought it sensible to dish out hundreds of millions of dollars on black athletes. 


"Unfortunately, we had to do something great for us to be viewed equally".
Transcend is a very special sounding word, but in this context, it's ...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiSQTMCbuSo


The race-transcending status bestowed to Jordan was fleeting, as it is for all minoritized peoples. Once word broke loose that Jordan had settled a gambling loss, media companies found it lucrative to pull Jordan back into the dominant cultural narrative surrounding black men in America. News reporters couldn't help but even tie it to the murder of his father, suggesting that it might have been payback for an unsettled debt. This then is the trap of any purported race-transcendence - so long as you (and all members of your group, really) walk the tight rope perfectly, you will be tolerated. But your elevated status is flexible, and you can be collapsed into the group at a moment's notice. Similarly, at another moment's notice, he was once more the All-American titan once the NBA finals were underway. America's darling once more.

marion note: 
make sure his inauthenticity, if there is any, is for real, he was inauthentic.



TALK ABOUT THE THIN LINE MJ WAS ON
WHEN IT WAS FKED
W GAMBLING
HE WAS BALCK ABAIn 
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/23/sports/bulls-jordan-says-check-covered-gambling-losses.htm







Drafted first overall in the 1996 draft, Allen Iverson, one of the greatest guards in the history of the sport, presented a unique challenge to corporate America. He was unapologetically black, charismatic, skilled and authentic in a way no player had ever been before. He was the antithesis of the supremely marketable Michael Jordan, the soon-to-be-retired face of the game. Jordan, tattoo-less, bald and speaking white English. And Iverson, cornrows, tattoos, armband thing.
![[Pasted image 20240310163925.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240310030750.png]]


![[Pasted image 20240310012253.png]]


Allen Iverson shifted the culture of the game and gave players the agency to have pride in their culture.
Successive waves of players took inspiration from it.
Per Shaq's interview: https://youtu.be/HgA-l-pGZP0?t=786


This fear of losing the white consumer would culminate at the so-called "Malice at the Palace", wherein multiple black players were prominently involved in a scuffle between players and fans (that was instigated by a white fan throwing a drink onto black forward Ron Artest, who was lying down on the scorer's table). The black players, who were expected to passively accept violence at the hands of white spectators were chastised, were suspended for a year without pay, despite being cleared of wrongdoing by criminal investigations.

![[Pasted image 20240310031204.png]]


For fear of losing white viewership, because of the 'tarnished' NBA image, league commissioner David Stern would enact a dress code designed to very clearly limit black cultural expression. 

It would prohibit chains, pendants.. 

![[Pasted image 20240310033937.png]]

The idea then was that black authenticity was not salable. Authenticity would have to be expressed via a narrow scope of sanitized, palateable blackness. 


The NBA, the entity that stood to profit from black bodies needed to police their image. By extension, the white consumer base polices the image of black professionalism.

##### the politics of facial hair


https://thebeardclub.com/blogs/beard-culture/where-are-the-beards-in-politics
https://www.jstor.org/stable/26612277
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51025574
https://archive.li/gl98n - "Dear Mr. Mulcair: Lose the beard"



In a domain like politics, the policing of minoritized bodies is done by voters. Some baseline level of 'professionalism' is expected of political candidates - 

Politics is a rare domain wherein policing the image of your minoritized professionals is of no real benefit 

Should Jagmeet's presentation fail to appease the Canadian voterbase, so be it - a more palateable body, in a more palateable attire will soon take his place. 










##### circling back to Jagmeet and brown ppl more generally

talk about the stereotypes of Indian and Sikh men that Jagmeet has to circumnavigate (that's a word right) to become palateable to his white voterbase. 
indians are a collective punching bag for the internet, and jagmeet confronts this by embracing his faith, and using style and fashion to make his faith palateable to white voters. 
fashion is just one of the things he does to transcend the cultural narratives brown men and sikh people have existed in within this nation state
he can speak both national languages
he had a distinguished career as a lawyer, deflecting stereotypes about brown men being taxi drivers and gas station workers
born in the country and speaks english without an accent
he is dressed so well that the stereotypes of stinkiness aren't even applicable 
and i mean dressing well also combats the poorly dressed stereotypes 
the beard that ppl will say is uncleanly is contrasted by his strong masculinity and build
not being from brampton (a city that is often thought of as being 'overrun with indians') and instead having been raised in windsor and st johns

it is then ONLY by transcending virtually every negative stereotype that surrounds his people, and being the first to do so and having crafted such a strong image for himself that he has found success in politics WHILE also being very true to his faith - continuing to wear his turban, kirpan, [speaking punjabi in the house of commons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWLAmQtfRjI) (? was it the HoC lol prolly), doing bhangara in public.

it is basically a masterclass on how to be yourself as much as possible and still find success in professional domains. of course, some of this is enabled by certain privileges, like having been financially well off enough to have been sent to a private school - but i mean, he went there bc the abuse he faced at school was bad enough for that. but also, he was from a wave of Sikhs who came as economic immigrants.
jagmeet singh is at once authentic and remarkably palateable, in a way no indian has managed to become in this country. his politics aren't far enough left for my tastes, but he has found a unique way to be unabashedly (is this the right word lole) himself and advance the image of sikh and brown people in canada tremendously. he has surely made my life easier, as a brown person in the nation state of canada.

And so in much the same way Jordan adorned suits to transcend his blackness, Jagmeet adorns suits to transcend his brownness. This isn't to suggest that either individual does not enjoy luxury clothing, but to remark that there is tact and purpose in these decisions, and that there is a means that is being achieved by these clothes in any case. 






\* ah something to think about here is whether i want this to be about jagmeet transcending his brownness, or his attire (and everything else) enabling a duality of being himself. or maybe i just yap about the attire and everything else, i.e. the participation in whiteness, to be what ...
like the point of all this shit is to show that you need to cultivate an image that is sufficiently palateable to white voters  or consumers. dont forget that when writing this section

TO ASCEND TO THE POSITION THAT IS TRADITIONALLY HELD BY WHITES, YOU MUST BETRAY YOUR IDENTITY SOMEWHAT - 
brown enough to speak a second language, but canadian enough to speak english without an accent
AND PLAY UP YOUR WHITENESS

```
they want a woman who looks like a baby 
but knows not to cry; 
a girl who’s mature enough to date older men 
but not mature enough to know why she shouldn’t. 
they want you to be cloyingly, lovingly childish until, suddenly, they don’t.

To become palatable to a white majority voter base, \[something about double consciousness] and play up one's whiteness. This is expertly done by Nikki Haley, a 2024 Republican Party presidential candidate and former governor of South Carolina. In a bid to garner favour with the GOP base, Haley, the daughter of immigrant Sikh parents from Punjab elects to avoid ... altogether. Jagmeet Singh is not white passing and doesn't have the privilege of 

Nikki Haley, the daughter of immigrant Sikh parents from Punjab actually foreg



"conflicting identities to the majority of the identities existent
within their environment""\[5.5]


And so Singh's palatability for his majority white voter base is conferred via his professional career, his being well-dressed and his lack of an accent - just brown enough (but not too brown) and just white enough to have his candidacy validated. 

![[Pasted image 20240229033121.png]]



Racialized people must quickly learn to play up and play down their v





and so Singh's identity is collapsible. in being minoritized in canada, he is at once assimilable, the model minoity and a nuisance. and this is despite his being as canadian as possible - born here, speaks both national languages, . take this example of him being told to leave the country 




the way we dress signals our degree of assimilation - it is the easiest tell that they're from 'here', and not a threat. embracing western fashion is separates us from immigrants, and we know that attitudes that people have towards immigrants sometimes. the clothing marks us as full, equal members of society - i felt that pressure when i moved to a mostly white city, ajax, from my neighbourhood in toronto which had more pepople that looked like me. everyone dresses in clothing thats 50$, more than id dream of spending on anything that weren't running shoes. and the clothing is endless - group membership to me then, as the outsider, is gated by how much i can fit in, and then the dead weight, my brown skin, is uplifted and saved by the tailored suits..

perhaps because the acquisition of expensive goods is taken to 'objectify’ social membership by making it undeniable
experts view ‘buying power’ as a true mark of personal worth and racial
equality, and as a powerful rebuttal to racism. Hence, marketing specialists
provide to most blacks a rather narrow vision of social membership.
https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/lamont/files/how_blacks_use_consumption.pdf 

Of course, I say this not to suggest that Singh begrudgingly dons his gucci
his wife is a fashion designer and co-founder of Jangiiro, a Punjabi clothing line.

Roussanov notes that spending on conspicuous consumption is not entirely counterproductive. In many communities, he says, it may be necessary to present a more affluent image to compete for jobs and to have a social life.








### why must he do it, scientifically ,,
https://www.unr.edu/nevada-today/blogs/2021/growing-up-as-a-woman-in-stem
Reports state that “the underrepresentation of women in leadership positions and in science, math, technology and engineering (STEM) domains leads people to form stereotype-based explanations that men possess and women lack the skills and traits necessary for success in those domains” (Cundiff and Vescio).

A major tool for maintaining this inequality is on-the-job harassment: Women and minorities often face hostile receptions in traditionally male- and white-dominated domains, which discourage them from entering and remaining in those domains



https://gould.usc.edu/why/students/orgs/ilj/assets/docs/21-1%20Dhillon.pdf
By de-
ferring to employers’ choices to enforce certain grooming codes against
Sikhs, courts force members of this religious minority to make a very diffi-
cult choice: retain their jobs or stay true to their religious beliefs. If Sikhs
want to retain their jobs, they must compromise their religious beliefs and
“cover” 12 by assimilating and adhering to American cultural norms in order
to comply with their employers’ grooming policies


Christiani-
ty’s cultural hegemony in the organization of the workweek based on the
Christian holy days. Congress, public schools, the state and federal courts,
government agencies at all levels, and other public entities adjourn for the
Christmas and Easter holiday seasons, but not for Eid, Diwali, or any other
non-Christian religious holiday. 17
The fact that religious practices associated with Christianity, such as the
observance of Christmas and Easter, are already accommodated at the insti-
tutional level makes it even harder for religious minorities to gain accom-
modation of their own religious practices.

\* as an addendum, i wish to note that in my view, jordan has been an incredible net positive to the black community. though largely apolitical during his playing days, he was the star who made it so that corporations thought it financially sensible to spend on black athletes. that was probably only possible because of that very carefully crafted image he's created. while he's still a billionaire and can't be expected to really represent working class issues, he has mentioned before he just wanted to be a role model, and amassing such financial success surely does something to that end.
