Hi there, I'm a software engineer from Toronto, Canada 🇨🇦
  
I graduated from the University of Toronto with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

I've been lucky enough to have completed a variety of internships in Software Engineering! I've interned previously at [[Ceridian]], [[Questrade]], [[Basis Technologies]] and the [[Government of Canada 🇨🇦]]. I'm always looking for new and exciting opportunities!

Thanks for visiting my site! Feel free to check out some of the projects I've been working on, or get in touch through any preferred channels!
