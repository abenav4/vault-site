The **University of Toronto** (**UToronto** or **U of T**) is a [public](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_university "Public university") [research university](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_university "Research university") in [Toronto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto "Toronto"), [Ontario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario "Ontario"), Canada, located on the grounds that surround [Queen's Park](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Park_(Toronto)> "Queen's Park (Toronto)"). It was founded by [royal charter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_charter "Royal charter") in 1827 as **King's College**, the first institution of higher learning in [Upper Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Canada "Upper Canada"). Originally controlled by the [Church of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_England "Church of England"), the university assumed its present name in 1850 upon becoming a secular institution. As a [collegiate university](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collegiate_university "Collegiate university"), it comprises 11 [colleges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College "College") each with substantial autonomy on financial and institutional affairs and significant differences in character and history. The university maintains three campuses, the oldest of which is St. George, located in [downtown Toronto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Toronto "Downtown Toronto"). The other two [satellite campuses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_campus "Satellite campus") are located in [Scarborough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Toronto_Scarborough "University of Toronto Scarborough") and [Mississauga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Toronto_Mississauga "University of Toronto Mississauga").
