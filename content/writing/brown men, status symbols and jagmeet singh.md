this will be the brown men and status symbols stuff ,,


Last November, Jagmeet Singh, leader of the NDP was lambasted by a number of ___ for carrying a Versace tote.
Ostensibly, this sort of discourse is par for the course for right-wing commentators. Taking aim at the aesthetics of politics rather than material consequence, and offering commentary littered with inaccuracies. In a time where 
- the leader of the Opposition co-owns a real estate investment company that owns a rental property \[3]
- his wife owns a rental property \[3]

- the intellectual titan Tristin Hooper even published an entire roleplay, assuming the identity of the bag. \[2]






Singh is by no means a champion of the working class. But his clothing isn't the tell. In his case, it never could be. The gucci whatever he adorns - they are what legitimize him in the eyes of the public as a candidate, 'despite' his brownness. 
Black and brown politicians must play up their WHITENESS


But he knows this and does it tactically \[4] 



Of course, I say this not to suggest that Singh begrudgingly dons his gucci


TO ASCEND TO THE POSITION THAT IS TRADITIONALLY HELD BY WHITES, YOU MUST BETRAY YOUR IDENTITY SOMEWHAT - 
brown enough to speak a second language, but canadian enough to know to not speak it in public
AND PLAY UP YOUR WHITENESS



there's no real winning though. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIe_ccbXF58
