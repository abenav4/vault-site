doug ford is ontario's present premier. it really doesn't matter where you land on the political spectrum - i can almost assure you that you'll despise this bottom feeder. ford and his cronies are among the most corrupt, self-serving politicians who operate within the anglosphere. 

ford is a career sleazebag. so much so, that i have trouble remembering what rubbish he gets up to. this list helps document some of the most consequential, awful things he's been up to. these are not blunders by a well-intentioned individual. these are deliberate, disgusting policy decisions that push people into homelessness and cause completely avoidable deaths. if you live in ontario, your life has been made markedly worse by this rat.

as a refresher, the following are (broadly) provincial/territorial responsibilities: 
- our health care system (namely OHIP, hospitals, and services provided by doctors and other health care professionals) [[you should hate doug ford#references]]
- education 
- social services [[you should hate doug ford#^5d16c3]]
- highways
- prisons [[you should hate doug ford#^9bd799]]

we'll broadly go in order from most catastrophic and evil to least.
### scrapping rent control

canada recognizes "adequate, safe housing as a fundamental human right".

thanks to ford, if your dwelling was constructed after 2018, your landlord can basically jack up your rent however much they want. as in, you can be faced with double-digit rent hikes, in consecutive years. that's a thing that happens.

Ford is a career swindler. These are not accidents. These are deliberate decisions that devastate livelihoods, push people into homelessness, lead to unnecessary deaths, fracture communities, and drive residents out of the province. <sup>[[#references|1]]</sup>
