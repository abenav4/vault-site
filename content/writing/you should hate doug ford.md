doug ford is ontario's present premier. it really doesn't matter where you land on the political spectrum - i can assure you, you should despise this bottom feeder. ford and his cronies are among the most corrupt, self-serving politicians who operate within the anglosphere.

ford is a career sleazebag. so much so, that i have trouble remembering what rubbish he gets up to. this list helps document some of the most consequential, awful things he's been up to. these are not blunders by a well-intentioned individual. these are deliberate, disgusting policy decisions that push people into homelessness and cause completely avoidable deaths. this low-life has tossed away billions of our tax dollars into the gutter. he's likely enriched his associates to the tune of many tens of millions of dollars (unsourced claim, but let me live).

if you live in ontario, and are not in his immediate circle, your life has been made markedly worse by this rat.

as a refresher, the following are (broadly) provincial/territorial responsibilities:

- our health care system (namely OHIP, hospitals, and services provided by doctors and other health care professionals) <sup>[\[1\]](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/health-care-system/reports-publications/health-care-system/canada.html)</sup>
- education (primary, secondary and post-secondary)
- social services (including ODSP, Ontario Works and programs addressing homelessness and domestic violence)
- housing (in part! housing is a joint responsibility between federal/provincial/municipal governments)
- highways
- prisons

the more catastrophic stuff is at the start. let's start.

### scrapping rent control

canada recognizes "adequate, safe housing as a fundamental human right".

thanks to ford, if your dwelling was constructed after 2018, your landlord can basically jack up your rent however much they want. as in, you can be faced with double-digit rent hikes, in consecutive years. that's a thing that happens.
